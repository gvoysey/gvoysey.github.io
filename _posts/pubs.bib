abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of our catheter guidance system using Single Equivalent Moving Dipole (SEMD) method to guide the tip of the cardiac ablation catheter to the site of origin of the arrhythmia. 3 different patterns of 8 bipolar electrodes were sutured on the right ventricular myocardium of 3 swine through a standard thoracotomy. Electrode cables passed subcutaneously to a ventral interscapular position were exteriorized, fixed by stay sutures, and the chest closed in layers. The animals' heart rate, pulse oximetry, femoral artery blood pressure, and body temperature were continuously monitored. As the epicardial electrodes connected to a stimulator delivered pacing spikes simulating focal ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 120 bpm, the BioSemi ActiveTwo system at a frequency of 1Khz with a symmetrically patterned array of 64 electrodes placed on the chest measured body surface potentials. A paralytic drug was used to reduce error in cardiac mapping by minimizing muscular activity and allowing for full respirator control of breathing. Both simulation and real catheter's movements were well detected (R=0.95) and the final localization error of a simulation catheter to a pre-defined target was less than 1 cm in imaginary space, which is equal to 0.4 cm in real space. These data support the validity of SEMD method for localizing the origin of arrhythmia in swine model.},

abstract = {Background: We developed and evaluated a novel system for guiding radiofrequency catheter ablation therapy of ventricular tachycardia. This guidance system employs an inverse solution guidance algorithm (ISGA) using a single equivalent moving dipole (SEMD) localization method. The method and system were evaluated in both a saline tank phantom model and in vivo animal (swine) experiments. Methods: A catheter with two platinum electrodes spaced 3mmapart was used as the dipole source in the phantom study. A 40-Hz sinusoidal signal was applied to the electrode pair. In the animal study, four to eight electrodes were sutured onto the right ventricle. These electrodes were connected to a stimulus generator delivering 1-ms duration pacing pulses. Signalswere recorded from 64 electrodes, located either on the inner surface of the saline tank or on the body surface of the pig, and then processed by the ISGA to localize the physical or bioelectrical SEMD. Results: In the phantom studies, the guidance algorithm was used to advance a catheter tip to the location of the source dipole. The distance from the final position of the catheter tip to the position of the target dipole was 2.22 ± 0.78 mm in real space and 1.38 ± 0.78 mm in image space (computational space). The ISGA successfully tracked the locations of electrodes sutured on the ventricular myocardium and the movement of an endocardial catheter placed in the animal’s right ventricle. Conclusion: In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using an SEMD inverse algorithm to guide a cardiac ablation catheter.},
