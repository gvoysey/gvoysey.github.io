title: Summary

I am a Master's student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.bu.edu) at Boston University.  My recent research interests focus on modeling cochlear synaptopathy and its upstream effects in the brainstem and midbrain to better understand the hearing impairments it may cause, and to design an objective diagnostic test to quantify synaptopathy in humans.

I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University.  My undergraduate research focused on neural modeling of auditory processing  in [zebra finches](https://github.com/gvoysey/gabor-strf/tree/master/doc).

I am also a Research Engineer at Boston University's [Hearing Research Center](http://bu.edu/hrc), where my work has included: developing  [ESME](https://esme.bu.edu), a GIS tool to help environmental regulators and marine biologists estimate the effects of anthropogenic noise on whales and other marine mammals; developing new functionality for  [unlock](http://unlockproject.org), a brain-computer interface for severely paralyzed patients that uses EEG for computer control; and developing [NinjaGame](https://crowdfunding.bu.edu/project/5434508a092065263529349a/updates/1), a video game tool for speech rehabilitation for children with cleft palates.
