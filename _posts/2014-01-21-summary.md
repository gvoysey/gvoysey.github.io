title: About Me
---

I am a Research Engineer at Boston University's [Hearing Research Center](http://bu.edu/hrc). For full details on my code, check out the [repos](https://github.com/gvoysey) I contribute to on GitHub.

# Research

My research interests focus on modeling the behavior of the human auditory system. In particular I am interested in studying cochlear synaptopathy and its upstream effects in the brainstem and midbrain to better understand the hearing impairments it may cause.

## Corti

I have developed [Corti](https://github.com/gvoysey/corti), a flexible modeling environment for the evaluation of subcortical auditory systems, as part of my Master's Thesis.

## The ESME project

[ESME](https://esme.bu.edu) is a GIS tool to help environmental regulators and marine biologists estimate the effects of anthropogenic noise on whales and other marine mammals. Its code is hosted [here](https://github.com/AuditoryBiophysicsLab/ESME-Workbench).

## The Unlock project

I have developed new functionality for [unlock](http://unlockproject.org), a brain-computer interface for severely paralyzed patients that uses EEG for computer control.

## NinjaGame

I have worked on [NinjaGame](https://crowdfunding.bu.edu/project/5434508a092065263529349a/updates/1), a video game tool for speech rehabilitation for children with cleft palates.

# Education

I received my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University. My [Master's thesis](https://github.com/gvoysey/thesis) explored using Corti to characterize the behavior of auditory models.

I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University. My undergraduate research focused on neural modeling of auditory processing in [zebra finches](https://github.com/gvoysey/gabor-strf/tree/master/doc).
