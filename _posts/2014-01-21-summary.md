title: Summary

I am a Master's student in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.bu.edu) at Boston University.  My recent research interests focus on modeling the neural changes in the auditory brainstem that are common to auditory neuropathy and tinnitus.

I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University.  My undergraduate research focused on neural model development in [zebra finches](https://github.com/gvoysey/gabor-strf/tree/master/doc).

I am also a Research Engineer at Boston University's [Hearing Research Center](http://bu.edu/hrc).  My work has included:

* Developing [ESME](https://esme.bu.edu), a GIS tool to predict the Effects of Sound on the Marine Environment.  This program provides regulators and marine biologists a tool to estimate the effects of man-made noise on whales and other marine mammals.
* Developing new functionality for  [unlock](http://unlockproject.org), a brain-computer interface for severely paralyzed patients.
* Developing NinjaGame, a video game tool for speech rehabilitation for children with cleft palates.
* Developing a database of stroboscopic images of gerbil cochlea, used to investigate propagation of sound along the basilar membrane.
