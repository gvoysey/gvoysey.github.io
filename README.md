This is my personal academic website.    It was built using Hyde,  a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.
